1.Install Dependencies

pip install ccxt numpy ta-lib python-dotenv

2.Run the Bot

Save the code as trading_bot.py.

Execute: python trading_bot.py.

Check trading_bot.log for activity.

3. Customize:

change strategy_type in main() to "RSI" or "MACD".

For live trading, uncomment order creation lines in execute_trade and add real API keys to a .env file:

API_KEY=your_api_key
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

After testing, the trading program ran without errors, and I fixed minor issues (data task concurrency and balance check) to enhance reliability. The code is fully functional, retains all requested features, and is optimized for performance. Itâ€™s ready for use in simulation mode or live trading with minimal adjustments. Let me know if further refinements are needed!
